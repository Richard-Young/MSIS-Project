Welcome to my blog! My name is Richard Young. I am a graduate researcher enrolled in the Master of Science in Information Science (MSIS) program at UA Little Rock. This is my blog for documenting my final MSIS project.

My first experience at UA Little Rock was as an undergraduate. I graduated in 2017 as an EAST scholar with a Bachelor of Science degree in E-commerce and an Information Technology minor. As I pursued my Bachelor’s degree, I gained my first exposures to web development, UI/UX principles of design, business analytics, and branding/marketing strategies.

Currently I am in my final year of completing my MSIS degree while I work as a [graduate researcher for COSMOS](http://cosmos.ualr.edu/about/richard/){:target="_blank"}, a research program focused primarily on online and social media behavioral studies. During my time with COSMOS, I have gained skills in data visualization, application development, and social media forensics. Additionally, I have served as a UI/UX team lead for two major tools, [Blogtrackers](http://cosmos.ualr.edu/tools/blogtrackers/){:target="_blank"} and [YoutubeTracker](http://cosmos.ualr.edu/tools/youtubetracker/){:target="_blank"}, developed by COSMOS. I am excited to have the opportunity to apply the many skills and insights I have gained as a graduate researcher towards my MSIS project.

Outside of COSMOS, I try to enjoy as many hobbies and adventures as time allows. I am recently married to a beautiful, nature-loving biologist who brings balance to my sometimes overwhelmingly geeky lifestyle. Since starting graduate school, I have purchased and maintained a 3D printer, started “collecting” board games, taken up miniature painting, been introduced to birding and herping, inherited a lemon tree, and become a proud cat dad. Also, in September, my wife and I are moving to Spain for a year. Needless to say, life is always busy and seldom boring.
