This week I finished reading _Practical Python and OpenCV, 4th Edition_.These final chapters (Chapters 7-11) introduced me to the following image processing techniques:
- Histogram Generation
- Blurring
- Thresholdings
- Gradients and Edge Detection
- Contours

Although these last chapters were focused primarily on object detection, a skill I likely wonâ€™t need for my MSIS project, I now feel like I have a solid grasp on how to approach Image Processing with OpenCV and Python. I am very glad the author introduced generating histograms from images because I think this technique will have useful applications to my project.

## Project Deliverable Update

Also, this week I started working with another member of COSMOS, Recep Erol, regarding my project. Recep has stepped in to help with the process of automating moviebarcode generation from Youtube videos. This collaboration will allow me to place my focus on developing techniques to use moviebarcodes for video analysis and categorization as well as developing the Django application.

## Going Forward
Next week I will work on applying the knowledge I have gained from the book to moviebarcodes I have previously generated. I will begin by exploring what kinds of analyses I can produce using the histogram processing techniques I learned this week.
