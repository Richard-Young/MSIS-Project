I am excited to say that I have successfully assembled my project committee! I would like to briefly introduce you to the faculty members of UA Little Rock that form my MSIS project committee:

## Dr. Nitin Agarwal (Chair) <span>| Professor of Information Science, UA Little Rock</span>

Dr. Agarwal is the director of COSMOS, the graduate research program with which I am involved, and I am happy to say that he is now also the chair of my project committee. Dr. Agarwal is one of the biggest reasons I returned to UA Little Rock to pursue a graduate degree. Dr. Agarwal is internationally known for his cyber forensics techniques in combating misinformation on various social media platforms. He has been an incredible mentor to me and has given me an exceptional experience during my past few years researching with COSMOS.

## Dr. Bruce Bauer <span>| Advanced Instructor of Information Science, UA Little Rock</span>

Dr. Bauer is the program coordinator for the E Commerce degree program at UA Little Rock where I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree. I asked him to be a member of my project committee because of his web expertise and background in application development. Additionally, I have interacted with Dr. Bauer both in my undergraduate classes as well as during my E Commerce capstone project, and throughout these experiences he provided me with quality guidance and insights.

## Dr. Joseph Williams <span>| Associate Professor of Rhetoric and Writing, UA Little Rock</span>

I have been mentored by Dr. Williams in both my undergraduate and graduate studies. During my undergraduate career, Dr. Williams first introduced me to user experience principles and testing. I had the opportunity to work with Dr. Williams again in Fall 2018 as my graduate mentor for my Independent Study elective in which I had an amazing experience studying Game Theory and Unity 3D Development. Dr. Williams has a wealth of knowledge regarding human computer interface design and human psychology in general, and I am grateful to have him as a member of my project committee.
