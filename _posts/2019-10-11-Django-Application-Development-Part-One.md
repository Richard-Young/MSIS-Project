This past week I began the Django application development process. This is my first experience developing with Django, and I am excited by what I have learned about Django in just a week and the applications of this knowledge moving forward.

Django provides a framework for web applications to use Python and interact with a database, and it is relatively quick and simple to create web prototypes using this framework. Additionally, the [official Django Project documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/){:target="_blank"} is well written and easy to follow.

If you are wanting to get started with Django and are looking for resources, here are a few that I used this week and found to be very helpful:
- [Model-View-Controller (MVC) Explained – With Legos](https://realpython.com/the-model-view-controller-mvc-paradigm-summarized-with-legos/){:target="_blank"}
- [Writing your first Django app](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial01/){:target="_blank"}
- [Django Tutorial (Create a Blog)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-FTlQ7Djqc&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ib4HsrXEYpQnTOTZE1x0uc){:target="_blank"} (Youtube Playlist)

After using the above resources, I now have an understanding of how to store and interact with data using Django. I have designed and begun to implement a strategy for generating and storing moviebarcode data from the project's existing code.

## Going forward
Next week, I will continue working on the Django Application, and I aim to have the application’s main functionality developed.
