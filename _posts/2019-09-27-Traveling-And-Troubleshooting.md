People take the things they know for granted. Whether you try communicating with someone who doesn’t understand or speak your language, or whether you try to run someone else’s code that is complicated by the differing work environments and results in errors, it can be hard to know how to get from A to B.

Although much of my time these past couple weeks has been spent moving to Spain, finding an apartment, and acclimating to the culture here, I have still managed to put a considerable amount of time into my project. However, I am frustrated that my output for this week is not reflective of my efforts.

This week has been consumed by what should have been a relatively simple task. I have been struggling to get my Ubunutu development environment to be compatible so that I can collaborate with a fellow COSMOS member, Recep, on the development of the moviebarcode generator and application. Even though the existing code for moviebarcodes developed by Recep has been tested in multiple environments, I keep receiving errors with OpenCV when compiling his scripts. I have spent an embarrassing amount of hours trying to troubleshoot this issue at every angle I can find, but so far nothing has worked. I am currently in contact with the author of the PyImageSearch tutorials I am following, so hopefully with his help this issue will be resolved this week.

What I have learned this week is that the process of installing OpenCV can be very fickle. For some, it configures no ploblem. For me and for many others, as seen in the following [post](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/05/28/ubuntu-18-04-how-to-install-opencv/){:target="_blank"} , this process can feel a little like the following GIF:

Going forward from such a frustrating week, it can be difficult to stay positive, especially considering that next week will mark just one month from when I have to provide my final project documentation. However, thankfully with the efforts of my collaborator, Recep, this project is actually ahead of schedule. Next week I plan to post an updated syllabus for this project with revised deliverables.
