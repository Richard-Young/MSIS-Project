This week I began the first proposed stage of my project timeline: “optimize moviebarcode generation development.” Although I created a proof of concept version of this project last semester for my Social Computing class, I recognize that I have knowledge gaps concerning the building blocks of this project, Python and Image Processing. This is why I allotted time in my project timeline to learn these foundational skills.

In order to address the knowledge gap that I am currently experiencing, I am taking a more formal approach and using a book to guide me in this process. I personally learn best with hands-on experience and examples, and I found a book that provides this type of learning experience, [“Practical Python and OpenCV, 4th Edition”](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/practical-python-opencv/){:target="_blank"} by Dr. Adrian Rosebrock. This is the same author who produces content for [PyImageSearch](https://PyImageSearch.com){:target="_blank"}, the blog I leveraged for usable code for my moviebarcode prototype. 

This book is a streamlined and hands-on guide to using OpenCV and Python. In the words of Rosenbrock, “This book is meant to be a hands-on, how-to guide to getting started with computer vision using Python and OpenCV” (Rosebrock, pg. 14). The book also includes supplementary videos, code snippets, and case studies. This is exactly what I need, so I’m off to a good start! Yay!

From reading the first few chapters, I already have a pretty firm grasp of how to begin working with individual pixels of an image. Since frames are just single images of a video, I need to learn how to analyze the pixels that compose these frames. These early chapters have already enriched my knowledge of how a computer displays pixels and how quickly and easily one can utilize Python libraries for image processing.

## Going Forward
Next week I will continue to read through Rosenbrock’s work and aim to showcase a demonstration of what I am learning through my study of this book.
