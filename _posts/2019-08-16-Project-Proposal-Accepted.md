This week I accomplished the first major milestone for my MSIS project: completion and acceptance of my project proposal!

This project will be a continuation of research efforts that I first began in Dr. Nitan Agarwal’s Social Computing Class (Spring 2019). During this class, I researched techniques for generating moviebarcodes from downloaded Youtube videos, and then I created a proof of concept user interface. A copy of this research report is provided in my official [Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bHH2Brtuh4rkgAxUf3fWJmN3kRDn9nY2yz_iwmt10VY/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

At the conclusion of this project I aim to provide the following:

Project Deliverables
- Python code development for automated moviebarcode generation that can be performed on Youtube videos
- A standalone Django app that generates moviebarcodes and can be integrated into the YoutubeTracker application

Project Timeline
- Optimize moviebarcode generation development (August 19 - September 22)
- Web application development and testing (September 23 - November 10)
- Prepare the final documentation (November 11 – November 14)
- Project defense (November 15)

## Going Forward

Now that my Project Proposal has been accepted by my project committee,  I am very excited to officially begin the research and development stage of my project. 

Expect an update next week!
